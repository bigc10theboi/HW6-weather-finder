Server side APIs assignment

## My Experience
This application utilizes every technique from previous assignments (bootstrap, javascript, css, moment, and jquery) while adding in an API to draw information from. The application draws info from Openweathermap's API to populate current weather and also has the option to look at the forecast fro the next five days. When looking at the current weather there is an adaptive button displaying UV index that changes with varying levels of UV. I could get my searches to appear in console but I couldn't figure out local storage and displaying them on the page.

## User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
